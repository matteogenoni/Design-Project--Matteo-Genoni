        <p>I’m Matteo Genoni, I am 14 years old and like to play sports, but especially skiing, so I chose to make my 
            website on the sport. I have very little experience with coding, since the only time that I have coded before 
            this year was in sec 1 design. However even though I don’t have a lot of experience, I am eager to learn, and 
            I am ready to incorporate both the coding we have learned so far, as well as any other code that I might have 
            to research into a really nice website. As I said, I really enjoy skiing, it is a very fun sport that I have 
            been practicing since I started walking. I ski a lot because my dad used to be a ski instructor in Switzerland, 
            and likes to teach me and my brothers now. I thought that doing my website on this would allow me to learn more 
            about skiing so that I can keep on improving. I’m going to create this website with visual code studio, and will 
            use the information that I have so far about code, skiing, design, etc, and other information on these topics 
            that I will research. My final goal for this website is to be able to let people access my website and inform 
            themselves with the information that I will have put on my website. </p>
