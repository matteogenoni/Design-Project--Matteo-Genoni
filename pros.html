            <br><br>
            <p>Skiing has evolved over time, and so have skiers. However there are some skiers that made a mark in history, 
                and this page will list 5 of the greatest skiers of all time. </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3> Bode Miller, USA</h3>

            <p>Olympic and World Champion, a two-time overall World Cup champion, 
                and most importantly, the most successful male American ski racer of all-time.</p>
            <h3> Ingemar Stenmark, Sweden</h3>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/88/22/6f8822666ae0a28ec1671b181344c517.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300">
            <p>Former World Cup ski racer, he is regarded as the greatest slalom and giant slalom skier of all 
                time with a total of 86 wins in international races.</p>
            <h3> Lindsey Vonn, USA</h3>
            <img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/fVuSR-T1aHafJuBi07EuaU7G10U=/415x233/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5c5469c9/turbine/ct-1549035969-bxx9mt04yr-snap-image" alt="" width="350" height="250">
            <p>American World Cup Alpine ski racer, who has won four World Cup overall 
                championships, a gold medal for downhill, and in 2016 won her 20th World Cup crystal globe title, passing
            Ingemar Stenmark with 19.</p>
            <!--Herman Maier is by far the most incredible skier in my opinion. I have watched his crash over and over,
            and the fact that he was able to compete after is just insane-->
            <h3> Hermann Maier, Austria</h3>
            <img src="https://www.watson.ch/imgdb/8127/Qx,A,0,0,580,387,278,177,32,32/4880981916109666" alt="" width="350" height="250">
            <p> 54 World Cup race victories (24 super-G, 15 downhills, 14 giant slaloms, and 1 combined). He is second for
                the men's all time list. As you can see in the picture above, he had an incredible fall during an olympic race,
                but he somehow managed to make an incredible recovery and compete in the next race.</p>
            <h3> Jean-Claude Killy, France</h3>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNT7AVM428_hVPLXz25nmrVn7DPF4iRkBi5A&usqp=CAU" alt="" width="350" height="250">
            <p>Triple Olympic champion in 1968, one of the first really successful skier, and winner of the first 
                two World Cup titles.</p>
