            <!--Skiing is awesome and I almost didn't need to use a source for this part! I knew everything already and
            only checked to make sure I was 100% right-->
            <h1>SKIING EQUIPEMENT</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>A very important step in skiing is finding the best equipement for yourself. In skiing, there is a
                lot of equipement needed, this page will explain the equipement and explain how it works.</p>
                <br><br>
            <h2>Skis</h2>
            <p>Skis are the most important part of equipement, and it is because of that that they have been modified
                throughtout the years. Now, there are many types of skis; here is a list of some of the more popular ones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All-rounders are self explanatory. They are the skis you would use if you are looking for an all-round ski.</li>
                    <li>Beginner skis are meant for beginners. They are a little shorter and lighter than all rounders, 
                        allowing more stability and agility.</li>
                    <li>Powder snow skis or freeride skis are growing in popularity and are wider and longer for more support.</li>
                    <li>Special types of skis have also been developped for different styles like slalom, giant slalom and downhill.</li>
                  </ul>
            <h2>Boots</h2>
            <p>Ski boots don't vary as much as skis, but they can have some small modifications depending on their purpose. 
               Ski boots protect the lower legs and ankles, and they transfer the movements to the skis. It is because of this that
               they are harder and less flexible than normal boots.</p>
            <h2>Bindings</h2>
            <p>Bindings are the piece that connects the boots to the skis. They are adjusted to the size of the boot and
                to the level of the skier and the type of skiing they will be used for. The adjustment provides the perfect
                transmission of movement and also a safe release in case the skier were to fall. If the adjustment is to tight, 
                then the ski won't detatch and the skier could injure himself much more.</p>
            <h2>Ski poles</h2>
            <p>While some people choose not to use poles, most do. This is because they provide more support and stability for the skier. 
                They also provide a good rythm for more advanced skiers. They move the poles in the same rythm as their skis for a perfect posture and technique.</p>
            <h2>Helmet</h2>
            <p>Helmets were surprinsingly only introduced about 20 years ago. However now many runs even require the use of a helmet.
                Helmets protect your head from impact and also keep you warm.</p>
            <h2>Goggles</h2>
            <p> Goggles protect your eyes from the cold and from the sun or snow. They are optional however most people use them.</p>
            <h2>Snow wear</h2>
            <p>Snow wear like a jacket, gloves, etc, are a really important factor to keep you warm and provide some protection.</p>
