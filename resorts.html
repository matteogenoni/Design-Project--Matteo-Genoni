            <h1>BEST MOUNTAINS AND RESORTS</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p> Skiing is becoming more and more of a popular sport. It started out as a sport for 
                mountaineers, but is now more inclusive for skiers of all levels. Nowadays, ski mountains know how to 
                attract the public by adding excellent hotels, restaurants, resorts, apres-ski entertainment, etc. But 
                of course the most important part are the slopes themselves. The best ski resorts will always be in 
                Europe and North America, as it is there that skiing is more popular, but other places in the world 
                are developing more and more resorts. This is a list of the top 10 best ski resorts in the world:</p>

            it was a place in Switzerland near Zermatt, one of the top 10 best resorts! The train we took in the morning 
        actually can bring you there.-->
